## Game rules

* Tic Tac Toe is a game for two players, e.g. X and O;
* The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares;
* You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O;
* Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares;
* The first player to get 3 of her/his/they marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner;
* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
